# Decisions

2025-08-15: Created separate repo (STL-manager) to isolate code/planning from blog and avoid large binary history.
2025-08-15: Phase 0 limited to read-only inventory of already extracted files; archives untouched.
2025-08-15: Adopted graded NSFW metadata (nsfw_level + exposure + act tags) to enable nuanced filtering beyond binary content_flag; detailed fields deferred until Phase 2 to avoid premature manual burden.
2025-08-15: Added cross-system lineage/race taxonomy (lineage_primary + subrace + aliases) and tabletop_role / pc_candidate_flag to support filtering (e.g., all elves, DnD adventurer humans vs Warhammer humans) without overfitting early; most advanced facets deferred to P2.
2025-08-15: Refined lineage model to two-tier (lineage_family vs lineage_primary) so distinct elf subtypes (high_elf, wood_elf, dark_elf, drow) remain separate while enabling broad family filters; lineage_primary postponed to P2.
2025-08-15: Expanded lineage_primary examples across all lineage families (not only elves) to ensure specificity (e.g., mountain_dwarf vs chaos_dwarf, ork vs orruk, vampire vs lich) and documented non-exhaustive controlled vocabulary strategy.
2025-08-15: Introduced versioned token normalization map (`tokenmap.md`) covering designer aliases, lineage tokens, faction/family mappings, NSFW cues, variant axis indicators, and confidence / warning rule ordering; baseline declared as token_map_version 1 for Phase 1 rollout.
2025-08-15: Expanded Warhammer 40K & Age of Sigmar faction coverage in token map (added full mainline armies & common aliases, corrected 'adeptus_astartes' typo) and bumped token_map_version to 2 to preserve reproducibility.
2025-08-15: Drafted normalization flow specification (`NormalizationFlow.md`) to formalize deterministic ordering, conflict handling, confidence scoring, and re-run strategy separate from vocabulary content.
2025-08-15: Added addon / upgrade fields (expanded part_pack_type; new addon_type, requires_base_model, compatibility_scope, compatible_units, compatible_factions, multi_faction_flag, attachment_points, replaces_parts, additive_only_flag, clothing_variant_flag, magnet_ready_flag) to support weapon/clothing/conversion packs in Phase 2.
2025-08-15: Introduced sculpt style metadata (style_primary P1; style_secondary_tags P2) with initial vocab (heroic, realistic, semi_realistic, stylized, anime, chibi, grimdark, low_poly, toon, other; secondary: gritty, painterly, gothic, biomechanical, baroque, organic, ornate, minimalist) to enable aesthetic filtering early; primary chosen for robust broad buckets, secondary deferred for optional refinement.
2025-08-15: Refined style taxonomy: limited style_primary strictly to anatomical proportion axis (realistic, heroic, anime) and renamed style_secondary_tags to style_aesthetic_tags for orthogonal aesthetic descriptors (grimdark, baroque, gothic, biomechanical, ornate, etc.) separating anatomy from surface/art direction.
2025-08-15: Added style_primary_confidence (certain/probable/guess) acknowledging explicit 'heroic' tokens uncommon; default inference workflow sets guess then escalates via manual review.
2025-08-15: Policy: Do not auto-assign style_primary when anime vs realistic is ambiguous; leave null unless explicit tokens or manual confirmationâ€”prevents mislabeling near-realistic anime-inspired sculpts.
2025-08-15: Added `scripts/quick_scan.py` (read-only token frequency scan) to surface overlooked vocab candidates before formalizing token map v3; stdout only, no persistence.
2025-08-15: Enhanced quick_scan with `--json-out` structured report (scanned_files, distinct_tokens, top_unknown_tokens, scale tokens, numeric tokens, suggestions) to enable diffing across runs.
2025-08-15: Added double-click batch wrapper `run_quick_scan.bat` and default behaviors (root=script dir, json_out=quick_scan_report.json) for frictionless ad-hoc scans.
2025-08-15: Increased quick_scan default file limit from 50k to 100k to cover larger collections without needing a flag override.
2025-08-15: Raised quick_scan default unknown token slice from 40 to 100 to broaden early vocab discovery without multiple reruns.
2025-08-15: Updated quick_scan to tokenize directory names (previously only file stems) to capture part/pose/category indicators often stored only in folder hierarchy; added --skip-dirs flag for backwards-compat and added scanned_directories field to JSON report.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 3 adding new designers (tinylegend, azerama), lineage expansions (ratfolk, kobold), future seed (minotaur), and documented planned tabletop-specific optional fields (equipment_type, pose_index, base_size_mm, base_shape, unit_role) gated on future tabletop intent detection to avoid noise for non-tabletop assets.
2025-08-15: Added dynamic vocab loading to quick_scan via --tokenmap parsing minimal sections of tokenmap.md (designers, lineage family_map, faction aliases, stopwords) to eliminate manual duplication and keep exploratory scan aligned with current map version; preserves embedded defaults as fallback.
