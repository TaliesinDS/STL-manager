# Decisions

2025-08-15: Created separate repo (STL-manager) to isolate code/planning from blog and avoid large binary history.
2025-08-15: Phase 0 limited to read-only inventory of already extracted files; archives untouched.
2025-08-15: Adopted graded NSFW metadata (nsfw_level + exposure + act tags) to enable nuanced filtering beyond binary content_flag; detailed fields deferred until Phase 2 to avoid premature manual burden.
2025-08-15: Added cross-system lineage/race taxonomy (lineage_primary + subrace + aliases) and tabletop_role / pc_candidate_flag to support filtering (e.g., all elves, DnD adventurer humans vs Warhammer humans) without overfitting early; most advanced facets deferred to P2.
2025-08-15: Refined lineage model to two-tier (lineage_family vs lineage_primary) so distinct elf subtypes (high_elf, wood_elf, dark_elf, drow) remain separate while enabling broad family filters; lineage_primary postponed to P2.
2025-08-15: Expanded lineage_primary examples across all lineage families (not only elves) to ensure specificity (e.g., mountain_dwarf vs chaos_dwarf, ork vs orruk, vampire vs lich) and documented non-exhaustive controlled vocabulary strategy.
2025-08-15: Introduced versioned token normalization map (`tokenmap.md`) covering designer aliases, lineage tokens, faction/family mappings, NSFW cues, variant axis indicators, and confidence / warning rule ordering; baseline declared as token_map_version 1 for Phase 1 rollout.
2025-08-15: Expanded Warhammer 40K & Age of Sigmar faction coverage in token map (added full mainline armies & common aliases, corrected 'adeptus_astartes' typo) and bumped token_map_version to 2 to preserve reproducibility.
2025-08-15: Drafted normalization flow specification (`NormalizationFlow.md`) to formalize deterministic ordering, conflict handling, confidence scoring, and re-run strategy separate from vocabulary content.
2025-08-15: Added addon / upgrade fields (expanded part_pack_type; new addon_type, requires_base_model, compatibility_scope, compatible_units, compatible_factions, multi_faction_flag, attachment_points, replaces_parts, additive_only_flag, clothing_variant_flag, magnet_ready_flag) to support weapon/clothing/conversion packs in Phase 2.
2025-08-15: Introduced sculpt style metadata (style_primary P1; style_secondary_tags P2) with initial vocab (heroic, realistic, semi_realistic, stylized, anime, chibi, grimdark, low_poly, toon, other; secondary: gritty, painterly, gothic, biomechanical, baroque, organic, ornate, minimalist) to enable aesthetic filtering early; primary chosen for robust broad buckets, secondary deferred for optional refinement.
2025-08-15: Refined style taxonomy: limited style_primary strictly to anatomical proportion axis (realistic, heroic, anime) and renamed style_secondary_tags to style_aesthetic_tags for orthogonal aesthetic descriptors (grimdark, baroque, gothic, biomechanical, ornate, etc.) separating anatomy from surface/art direction.
2025-08-15: Added style_primary_confidence (certain/probable/guess) acknowledging explicit 'heroic' tokens uncommon; default inference workflow sets guess then escalates via manual review.
2025-08-15: Policy: Do not auto-assign style_primary when anime vs realistic is ambiguous; leave null unless explicit tokens or manual confirmationâ€”prevents mislabeling near-realistic anime-inspired sculpts.
2025-08-15: Added `scripts/quick_scan.py` (read-only token frequency scan) to surface overlooked vocab candidates before formalizing token map v3; stdout only, no persistence.
2025-08-15: Enhanced quick_scan with `--json-out` structured report (scanned_files, distinct_tokens, top_unknown_tokens, scale tokens, numeric tokens, suggestions) to enable diffing across runs.
2025-08-15: Added double-click batch wrapper `run_quick_scan.bat` and default behaviors (root=script dir, json_out=quick_scan_report.json) for frictionless ad-hoc scans.
2025-08-15: Increased quick_scan default file limit from 50k to 100k to cover larger collections without needing a flag override.
2025-08-15: Raised quick_scan default unknown token slice from 40 to 100 to broaden early vocab discovery without multiple reruns.
2025-08-15: Updated quick_scan to tokenize directory names (previously only file stems) to capture part/pose/category indicators often stored only in folder hierarchy; added --skip-dirs flag for backwards-compat and added scanned_directories field to JSON report.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 3 adding new designers (tinylegend, azerama), lineage expansions (ratfolk, kobold), future seed (minotaur), and documented planned tabletop-specific optional fields (equipment_type, pose_index, base_size_mm, base_shape, unit_role) gated on future tabletop intent detection to avoid noise for non-tabletop assets.
2025-08-15: Added dynamic vocab loading to quick_scan via --tokenmap parsing minimal sections of tokenmap.md (designers, lineage family_map, faction aliases, stopwords) to eliminate manual duplication and keep exploratory scan aligned with current map version; preserves embedded defaults as fallback.
2025-08-15: Added --ignore-file (suppress specified tokens from unknown list) and --emit-known-summary (domain counts + JSON fields ignored_tokens, domain_summary) to quick_scan to focus on genuinely new vocabulary amid high-frequency but uninteresting tokens.
2025-08-15: quick_scan now auto-loads `ignored_tokens.txt` (if present beside script) when --ignore-file is not provided, reducing friction for repeated exploratory scans.
2025-08-15: Added --include-archives flag to quick_scan to optionally tokenize archive filenames (zip/rar/7z/cbz/cbr) without extraction, capturing collection metadata hints embedded only in archive names; JSON now includes scanned_archives.
2025-08-15: Added --archive-sample flag to quick_scan to surface low-frequency archive-only tokens not present in main unknown slice for early detection of novel designers or content tags.
2025-08-15: Enhanced tokenizer normalization: strips wrapper punctuation (),[]{}+ trims leading '@', removes trailing '.stl' residue inside tokens (e.g., 'unsupported.stl' -> 'unsupported') reducing noise in unknown list.
2025-08-15: Added singular 'part' to variant axis vocabulary to catch archives using 'part' instead of 'parts' for segmentation indicators.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 4 adding numerous newly confirmed designers (hybris_studio, pikky_prints, warsteel_miniatures, momoji, moonfigures, three_dmoonn, funservicestl, miyo_studio, megha, kuton, zahen_studio, chuya_factory, kuru_figure, nomnom, nympha3d, moxomor, mezgike, abe3d, ca3d, jigglystix, torrida, skarix, xo3d) plus consolidation of oxo3d spellings; extended ratfolk lineage synonyms (ratkin, ratmen); added futa to strong nsfw cues; classified 'uncut' as merged segmentation alias.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 5 incorporating extended designer list from user-provided roster (rubim, pink_studio, dinamuuu3d, torrida_minis, zf3d, gsculpt_art, aliance, messias3d_figure, obstetrician_m_booth, vx_labs, cw_studio/chickenwar, es_monster, gm3d, kangyong, manilovefigures, peachfigure, officer_rhu, exclusive3dprinting, rushzilla, francis_quez) and normalized multi-word / punctuation variants.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 6 adding short alias 'esm' for es_monster to capture abbreviated archive naming.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 7 adding large bulk designer alias ingestion from extended user list (artifex3d, atelier_ryza, bam_broken_anvil_monthly, bella_nacht_miniatures, brunoart3d, bulkamancer, carlos_eduardo, chagarin, alvaro_stuardo, cyber_forge, titan_forge, gambody, dmg_minis, dodomo_studio, dt_minis, eightlegsminiatures, ella_art, epic_minis, ritual_casting, figuremaster, gible_art, gilmore_studio, gr8_studio, greytide_studio, h3ll_creator, hobbyhouse, il_paddyy, kigglystix, jojoba, double_vertex, kitno, kugo_figures, leonardo_murilo, lionrealm_studio, loot_studios, lost_kingdom, lucas_perez_studio, mads_minis, marta_punkgirl, mcm3d, mythreal_games, nebula4444, neko_figurines, nerikson, night_sky_miniatures, nr3ds, one_page_rules, psmini, qb_works, raw_ronin_arts_workshop, red_clay, rks3d, sakosigue_art, saltsculpt, serik_collection, shinobu_sculpt, sin3dstudio, siryll_art, soarez3d, stephanov_sculpts, tc_random_collectibles, tenshi_figures, the_printing_lord, the_beholder_miniatures, toon_studios, trick_or_treat, twin_goddess_miniatures, ukupalua, union_creative, xhunart, zez_studios, gaz_minis, three_dartguy, box_studio, nutshell_atelier) with normalized spacing/punctuation; duplicates consolidated.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 8 externalizing large designers section into `designers_tokenmap.md` to reduce churn in core map and enable independent versioning; tokenmap now references external file conceptually.
2025-08-15: Added external designers loading support in quick_scan (`--designers-file` with default fallback designers_tokenmap.md) and optional `--strip-designer-suffixes` heuristic to collapse variants like *studio, *minis, *prints after alias recognition.
2025-08-15: Bumped token_map_version to 9 removing residual inline designer alias block lines left over after externalization; replaced with explicit sentinel (`designers: external_reference`) ensuring single source of truth is `designers_tokenmap.md`.
2025-08-16: Added new metadata fields for broad asset categorization: asset_category (P1), and planned P2 fields terrain_subtype, vehicle_type, vehicle_era, base_theme. Rationale: collection includes substantial non-character assets (terrain, foliage, vehicles, decorative base sets); early coarse category improves filtering and prevents misapplying character-centric heuristics (e.g., pc_candidate_flag) to terrain/vehicle records. Controlled vocab seeds added to `MetadataFields.md`; conservative default = miniature when ambiguity.
2025-08-16: Bumped token_map_version to 10 adding preliminary (inactive in P1) `codex_units` seed list for Warhammer 40K Space Marine core/primaris units (intercessors, assault/heavy variants, tactical, aggressors, terminators, bladeguard, eradicators, hellblasters, infernus, inceptors, sternguard, desolation). Marked with activation gating for future Phase 2; rationale: capture high-frequency unit tokens early for consistent future normalization while avoiding current misclassification risk.
2025-08-16: Bumped token_map_version to 11 externalizing `codex_units` into dedicated files (`codex_units_w40k.md`, `codex_units_aos.md`, `codex_units_oldworld.md`) and replacing inline block with sentinel `codex_units: external_reference`. Added multi-faction initial coverage (40K core infantry/vehicle samples across Space Marines, Necrons, Tyranids, Orks, Astra Militarum, Adeptus Mechanicus, Chaos Space Marines; AoS core for Stormcast, Cities, Fyreslayers, Kharadron, Seraphon, Sylvaneth, Ossiarch Bonereapers, Nighthaunt, Chaos pantheon samples, Gloomspite, Orruk Warclans, Ogor Mawtribes, Skaven, Sons of Behemat; Old World early Bretonnia, Empire, Dwarfs, Orcs & Goblins, Tomb Kings, Skaven). Rationale: reduce core file churn, enforce contextual activation, enable iterative safe expansion.
