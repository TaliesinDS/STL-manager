# Note: the Python standard library includes the `sqlite3` module which is
# sufficient for the project's SQLite usage in most environments. The
# `pysqlite3-binary` wheel is optional and is known to be unavailable for
# some Windows/Python combinations; install it only if you specifically need
# an external SQLite driver. Example (manual):
#   pip install pysqlite3-binary
